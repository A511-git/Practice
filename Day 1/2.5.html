    <p><b><i>Clash of Clans</i></b> is a 2012 free-to-play mobile strategy video game developed and published by Supercell. The game was released for iOS platforms on 2 August 2012, and on Google Play for Android on 7 October 2013. Since 2016, an animated web series based on the game and Clash Royale, entitled Clash-A-Rama!, began being released to YouTube by Supercell. A comedic spin on the game, it was produced by Tolerable Entertainment with animation by Rough Draft Studios; voice actors such as Tom Kenny and Charlie Adler were involved in voice acting.

    The game is set in a fantasy-themed[3] persistent world[4] where the player is the chief of a village. Clash of Clans tasks players to build their own village using the resources gained from attacking other players' villages with troops, earning rewards, buying them with medals or by producing them at their own village. Players can conjoin to create clans – groups of up to fifty players – who can then participate in Clan Wars together, donate and receive troops, and chat with each other. Players can also build up a Clan Village called a Clan Capital.[5]

    Clash of Clans was released to generally positive reviews from critics. Four spin-off games in the same universe of Clash of Clans were developed by Supercell. The first, Clash Royale, was released in 2016.[6] The other three, Clash Quest, Clash Mini, and Clash Heroes, were announced in April 2021.[7][8] Clash Quest development was discontinued on 17 August 2022.[9] On 13 March 2024 Supercell announced that development on Clash Mini would also end, but elements from it would be brought to Clash Royale.[10] Supercell announced on 24 June 2024 that development on Clash Heroes had been terminated in favor of a replacement named Project R.I.S.E.[11]

        <h2>Gameplay</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Clash of Clans is a strategy video game with elements of city-building games. Players build a village from the ground up, collecting and utilizing resources while also training troops to attack other players' villages to gain resources and trophies. Players can (and usually do) form communities called clans, which are groups of up to 50 people. Clans players can donate troops to each other and can go on war with other clans. There are multiple currencies or resources in the game, including Gold, Elixir, Dark Elixir, Gems and 3 different ores, Shiny Ore, Starry Ore, and Glowy Ore.[3] Gold and Elixir are used to build and upgrade buildings like defenses, resource collectors etc. Elixir and Dark Elixir are also used to upgrade army-related buildings, troops, spells, and heroes. In the past, they were also used to train the troops but since July 2022 training is made free.[12]</p>
