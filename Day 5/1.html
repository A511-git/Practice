    <p id="a">“The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.”</p>
    <p id="b">“In this world, wherever there is light – there are also shadows.” “Wake up to reality! Nothing ever goes as
        planned in this accursed world.” “The longer you live, the more you realize that reality is just made of pain,
        suffering, and emptiness.” “Love is not necessary, power is the only true necessity.” “When a man learns to
        love, he must bear the risk of hatred.”</p>
    <p id="c">“I’m not a hero, I’m a villain.” “I’m not a hero, I’m a monster.” “I’m not a hero, I’m a god.” “I’m not a legend, I’m a warning.”</p>
    <p>This is a long sentence added as an example: "Despite the challenges and obstacles that may arise along the way, perseverance, determination, and a positive mindset can help you achieve your goals and turn your dreams into reality, no matter how difficult the journey may seem at first."</p>
    <p>This is a short sentence added as an example: "Success is a journey, not a destination."</p>
    <p>This is a long sentence added as an example: "In the grand tapestry of life, every thread, no matter how small, contributes to the overall picture, weaving together experiences, emotions, and lessons that shape who we are and how we perceive the world around us."</p>
